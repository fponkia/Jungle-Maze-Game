# Jungle Maze Game

This project builds a descriptive game. Where the user have to find a way to get out of the maze. There are some locations on the map, where the user cannot go, as it will lead to death on those locations. Each location has a description on what is like to be at that location, and what a user can see from that location on all the sides.

User also can collect some items that are located at some locations, which can help a user to enter some locations, and also help them tackle some issues faced during the game, while finding the locations.

The User will be given points depending on the items, the user have, when the user finish the maze.
